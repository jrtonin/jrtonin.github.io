## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}

setwd(dweiimd)

jpeg("pressure.jpg") 
# your plot for example    
plot(pressure)
dev.off()

```

![ff](./essay_ii_figures/pressure.jpg)

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
